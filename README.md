# First Git Project

This is my first GitHub repository, created to learn the basics of Git, GitHub, and version control. The main focus is writing and tracking a simple C++ program.

## 👩‍💻 Project Content

This repository contains a basic C++ program called `hello.cpp` that prints a message to the console.

## 📂 Files

- `hello.cpp` – A simple "Hello, GitHub!" C++ program  
- `.gitignore` – Ignores `.exe` files from being pushed to GitHub

## 🛠️ How to Run

If you have a C++ compiler installed (like `g++`), you can compile and run the program using the terminal or command line:

```bash
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
./hello
Hello, GitHub!
```
